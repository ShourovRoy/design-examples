# Modify the website

Modify the existing code and convert it to a good navbar which can be found in `result` folder.

## Rules

- Read the comments in css and html code to better understand
- Remove Blue color and make the color code "eee" without touching the inline css
- Fix issues
- Remove extra spacing from the window
- See what you want to make in result folder. You will get a screenshot which you need to make
- Make sure to read comments
